Because our Moran's I statistic for both Rook's and Queen's adjacency is greater than 0, we have indicated that there is a positive autocorrelation in the counties dataset. However, because the Moran's I value is below 0.3, the autocorrelation is not very strong. In Geary's C, a value of 1 indicated no autocorrelation, while values greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1 indicate positive autocorrelation and values greater than 1 indicate a negative autocorrelation. Therefore, we would interpret our results from the Geary's C test the same as with Moran's I to mean that there is positive autocorrelation in the counties dataset. In the municipalities dataset, we see strong positive spatial autocorrelation due to our Moran's I results, which are above 0.3 for both Queen's and Rook's adjacencies. Similarly, we can interpret our Geary's C statistic to indicate a positive autocorrelation.

```
The global G statistic helps determine whether a spatial dataset has clusters of high values or low values that contribute most to an overall finding of positive spatial autocorrelation. For the PA counties in the crime dataset a global G value of 2.44455963081884 implies that "cold spots" or clusters of low values are contributing the most to the positive correlation.

GWR

Using GWR, we build a model to predict the number of crimes in Mifflin County given the population, number of precincts in, and the area of the counties nearby. We can fit the model with an ordinary least squares regression procedure:

C = b0 + b1(POP_CRI01) + b2(AG_CRI01) + b3(Area) + e

The results of the GWR show that the Quasi-global R2 is equal to 0.9791978, which accounts for nearly all of the variance in the dataset.

The process of calculating the coefficients for the regression model was extremely difficult. If this is included on the final exam, please explain this process in detail with code examples beforehand.

Part C: Inverse Distance Weighting and Ordinary Kriging

```{r}
# Import data
Sensor <- readOGR("C:/Users/raana/OneDrive/Desktop/GIS/Ozone_Sensor_Locs", "Ozone_Sensor_Locs")
PACounty <- readOGR("C:/Users/raana/OneDrive/Desktop/GIS/PA_County_Select", "PA_County_Select")
O3value <- read.delim("C:/Users/raana/OneDrive/Desktop/GIS/Data/Ozone_Value.dat",header= FALSE,sep="|")
colnames(O3value) <- c("Valid_Date","Valid_Time","AQSID","Sitename","GMI","Parameter","Unit","Value","Source")
```
```{r}
Sensor
```
```{r}
PACounty
```
```{r}
O3value
```
In order to calculate distance weights between attribute (O3) values in the dataset, we need to associate ozone value readings (O3value$Value) with specific sensor locations (Sensor$coordinates).

To do this I first try to narrow down the O3value dataset to observations with ID numbers that exist in the Sensors dataset.

```{r}
# Convert id column in sensor location dataset to integer to match with ozone data
Sensor$id <- as.integer(Sensor$id)
# Merge datasets on ID
Sensor_df <- as.data.frame(Sensor)
O3_df <- as.data.frame(O3value)
merged <- merge(Sensor_df, O3_df, by.x="id", by.y="AQSID")
# Convert merged dataset back to spatial
coordinates(merged) <- ~long+lat

merged
```
```{r}
W_o3 <- as.matrix(dist(coordinates(merged),method = "euclidean", upper = TRUE))
W_o3
```
This is my attempt to calculate the interpolated values at each centroid location. However, I am stuck on how to get the 5 nearest values.

```{r}
pacents <- coordinates(PACounty)
mgcents <- coordinates(merged)
PA_int <- c()

for (i in 1:len(PACounty$COUNTY)){
  zz <- 0
  # get 5 nearest observations in merged
  px <- pacents[i,1]
  py <- pacents[i,2]
  n5 <- c()
  for (t in 1:length(merged$id)){
    nx <- mgcents[t,1]
    ny <- mgcents[t,2]
    d <- sqrt((px-nx)^2+(py-ny)^2)
    append(n5, d, after=length(n5))
    n5 <- sort(n5,decreasing = FALSE)
    n5 <- n5[1:5]
  }
  
  for (j in 1:5){
    wij <- (W_o3[i,j])^(-1)
    zz <- zz + wij*o35n
  }
  zi <- zz/5
  append(PA_int,zi,after = length(PA_int))
}

centrs

```

No instruction was ever given in class on how to perform an ordinary kriging analysis. This was extremely difficult. Please explain better the process if this will be included on the final exam.
